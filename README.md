## How to get started developing on this project

* Rails 4.2.5 is the current base install. Ruby version is defined in Gemfile as 2.2.1, with automatic RVM config in .ruby-gemset and .ruby-version.
* To get started, you should [obtain RVM](https://rvm.io/), and execute `rvm install 2.2.1; rvm use 2.2.1; rvm gemset create scheduler`
* PostgreSQL is the database, and [requires setup on each development instance](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-14-04). `development` and `test` environments currently make the following assumptions:
  * The database is located on `localhost` and is accessible via UNIX socket
  * The PostgreSQL user matching your username can be authenticated as the current user via a passwordless authentication mechanism. You may need to edit your `pg_hba.conf` to achieve this - setting your user to `peer` authentication via UNIX sockets is a working method.
  * The PostgreSQL user has the `CREATEDB` privilege (as `postgres` execute `ALTER USER {username} CREATEDB`)
  * Heroku users should be fine, as long as the `DATABASE_URL` is set in the environment. Likewise, if you wish to override these settings, you can also craft a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to do so.
* `capybara-webkit` is required by this project and will be installed automatically into your gemset by `bundler`.
  * It depends upon [Qt being installed](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit), and preferably Qt5. This can be achieved with `brew install qt` on OSX, or `sudo apt-get install qt5-default libqt5webkit5-dev` on Linux Mint.
  * It also depends upon a JS driver of some description, so you may need to `sudo apt-get install nodejs` too, if you don't already have one installed.
  * The approach to back and front end testing roughly follows [this advice from Thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications).
* Once these pre-requisites have been satisfied, you should be able to run the setup script at bin/setup.

## Development process

* All work should be performed on a separate branch, which is then pushed to the Github repository.
* A pull request into master should then be created for that branch, which will trigger Hound, Travis and Coveralls.
* The pull request will be reviewed by another committer, and either merged, or have further changes requested.
* Pull requests which either break Travis or cause Hound style violations will not be merged until these are resolved.

## Testing approach

We should ideally use a TDD/BDD approach:

* Start with a new issue / user story and branch, as described above.
* Write a breaking feature test in Capybara that describes expected behaviour, in `spec/features/[behaviour]_feature_spec.rb`. Consider using `js: true` to run tests in a headless browser when JS is likely to be used.
* Write subtests / unit tests as necessary to simplify requirements, going from the outside in, i.e. feature test, routing tests, view tests, controller tests, model tests.
* Unit tests should mock or stub code outside of their own purview, whereas feature tests can roam through the entire codebase. We should *never* make actual calls to live APIs or external services during test running though.
* Write code to solve the tests, working recursively up the chain of broken tests and ensuring that any knock-on test failures elsewhere are resolved.
* Do not make a pull request if you have any test failures. They need to be fixed. Ideally, don't make a pull request with any tests set to 'pending' either.
* We can't reasonably achieve full test coverage on code generated by Rails itself, but we should be able to get 100% coverage on our own code, using mocks and stubs as necessary.
* Code coverage is measured at time of pull request on GitHub, using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/nineworldsgeekfest/scheduler). SimpleCov is included in the Gemfile, but is not set up for local reporting. Less than 100% isn't a guaranteed blocker, but it will be taken into account in approving the request.

There are a few gems that may be included later in development to improve testing capabilities, notably FactoryGirl to generate test data, and Webmock to break on attempted external calls.

## Style notes

* Hound CI uses Rubocop with the [community Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and so do we. All pull requests will return in-line comments on style violations.
* Rubocop is included in the Gemfile under dev and can be used to find and fix style issues on your local dev environment.

## Deploying the project to Heroku

We're using Heroku as a handy way of trying out the project on a live platform with minimal fuss. To deploy to Heroku:

* You'll need a Heroku account. Sign up at https://www.heroku.com/ if necessary.
* Set up a dev environment using the instructions above, and use git to clone the project to your local environment.
* Follow [these instructions from Heroku's site](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4) to set up Heroku toolbelt, log in to Heroku CLI, create a dyno, push your master branch to the dyno, and migrate the database schema.
* If you just want to deploy the master branch, the Heroku instructions will see you right. If you want to deploy a different branch, use `git push -f heroku local-topic-branch:refs/heads/master` to deploy your current branch to Heroku.
* `Heroku run rake db:[whatever]` is your friend for sorting out the database. We may add the option to generate test data at a later point.

There are some Heroku-specific modifications to the codebase:

* `production.rb` has a line that creates a secret key on the dyno.
* Gem `rails_12factor` in Gemfile is required for Heroku.
